## My process

Wanted to setup this project with the 'project setup' as my learning objective. How to structure files / how to setup the basics for CSS/SCSS, like fonts, variables, colors etc.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- CSS variables
- SCSS mixins and base file
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Builder
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax) - For styles

### What I learned

build more projects with the same stack. After a deeper dive in node.js (backend) i've noticed how much of the frontend stuff had left my brain. Needed to llok up a lot off stuff, what some months ago were just standard drills.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰');
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

Use more of the same stack and become better. don't get lost in the sea of frameworks and try to understand every thing. just stick to the basics.
